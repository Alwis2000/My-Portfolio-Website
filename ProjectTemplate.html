        <p>A 3D Render of Daft punk I made in blender as a tribute to the iconic legendary duo</p>
        <p>I've always listened to their songs as a kid and it influenced my taste of music so much, knowing that they departed as a duo is unfortunate but I can't forget their music and their iconic appearances so I made this artwork as a homage to them.</p>
